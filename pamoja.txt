## Design Reference Template - DETAILED DESCRIPTION

### CRITICAL: You MUST strictly follow the attached charity website template design

I have attached a reference website template that shows EXACTLY the design pattern and layout I want. Here's what I see in that template and what you must replicate:

#### Template Color Scheme
The template uses:
- Deep forest green/teal as primary color
- Bright yellow/gold accents
- White backgrounds with colored sections
- Clean, modern card-based layouts

**IMPORTANT**: Instead of the green in the template, you will use the navy blue and blue gradient colors from the Pamoja Outreach Foundation logo I've attached. Use blues and complementary colors that work harmoniously with blue throughout the design.

#### Template Navigation Bar
- Fixed/sticky navigation that stays at the top as you scroll
- Logo on the left
- Menu items in the center: Home, Campaigns, About Us, Pages, Blog, Contacts
- Search icon and user icon
- "DONATE NOW" button in a distinct color on the right
- Clean, professional spacing

**For our site**: Navigation items should be: Home | About Us | What We Do | Recent Works | Contact Us + DONATE NOW button

#### Template Hero Section Layout
The template shows:
- Full-width hero banner with split design
- Left side: Dark colored background (green in template - use navy blue for us) with:
  - "NON-PROFIT CHARITY" label
  - Large headline: "Give Hope To Children In Need."
  - Two buttons: "DONATE NOW" (solid colored) and "VIDEO PLAYING THEME" (outlined)
  - Decorative elements/patterns
- Right side: Large hero image of smiling children with yellow accent background
- Decorative floral/sunburst graphics
- Overall clean, modern, inspiring design

**REPLICATE THIS EXACT LAYOUT** but with our colors and content.

#### Template "What We Do" Section Style
The template shows three card-style boxes with:
- Images of children/beneficiaries
- Overlay with program titles
- Icons/buttons
- Hover effects
- Rounded corners
- Clean spacing between cards

**You must create similar cards for our four focus areas** (Orphan Support, Elderly Care, Medical Assistance, Education Sponsorship).

#### Template Statistics/Impact Section
The template shows:
- Large images of beneficiaries
- Statistics with percentages (59%, 58%)
- "Save Water", "Education" labels
- Testimonial quote with attribution
- Clean typography
- "ABOUT US" button

**Adapt this for our About Us section** with relevant statistics about our impact (use placeholders).

#### Template "Delivering Solutions" Section
The template shows:
- Dark green/teal background (use navy blue for us)
- White text on dark background
- Title: "HOW WE HELP" / "Delivering Solutions"
- Grid of white cards with:
  - Images in rounded frames
  - Program titles in bold
  - Descriptions
  - Clean spacing
- "EXPLORE MORE" button at bottom

**This is EXACTLY what I want for our "What We Do" section.**

#### Template Card Design Pattern
Throughout the template, cards have:
- Rounded corners (border-radius)
- Drop shadows for depth
- Hover effects (subtle lift/scale)
- Clean white backgrounds
- Consistent padding and spacing
- High-quality images
- Clear typography hierarchy

**Use this card pattern consistently throughout our site.**

#### Template Footer
The template footer shows:
- Dark background
- Multiple columns with:
  - Logo and description
  - Quick links
